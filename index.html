            <br>
            <br>
            It is common for someone to become anxious, worried, or tense in a this situation, but try to take a few deep breaths and relax. Remember why you're taking this exam. Is it to get into your dream school? To get good grade? To make your family proud? Whatever the reason, it's something you've been working towards for a long time.
            <br>
            <br>
            So take a deep breath, stay calm, focus on your studies, and trust yourself. You're going to do great.
